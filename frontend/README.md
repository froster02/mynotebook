### Backend:
- **Authentication**:
  - User registration, login, and authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
  - Middleware (`fetchuser`) ensures secure access to user-specific routes.
- **Notes Management**:
  - Secure API routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes.
  - Notes are associated with individual users, ensuring data privacy.
- **Database**:
  - MongoDB is used as the database, with schemas for users and notes.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React (via Create React App)**: For building the user interface.
- **Bootstrap CSS**: For responsive and modern UI design.
- **React Router**: For navigation between pages.
- **React Context API**: For managing global state.

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: For server-side logic.
- **Express.js**: For handling RESTful API routes and middleware.
- **MongoDB**: For database storage.
- **Mongoose**: For object modeling and schema validation.

## React Hooks Used

1. **`useState`**:
   - Manages local state, such as the list of notes and their updates.
   - Example: Used in `NoteState.js` to manage adding, editing, and deleting notes.

2. **`useContext`**:
   - Provides access to `noteContext`, enabling global state management.
   - Example: Used in `Notes.js` to fetch and display the list of notes.

3. **`useEffect`**:
   - Tracks changes in the user's location path for dynamic page updates.
   - Example: Used in `Navbar.js` to react to location changes.

## API Endpoints

### Authentication:
- **POST** `/api/auth`: Register a new user.
- **POST** `/api/auth/login`: Login and receive a JWT.
- **GET** `/api/auth/getuser`: Get user details using the JWT.

### Notes:
- **GET** `/api/notes/fetchallnotes`: Fetch all notes for the logged-in user.
- **POST** `/api/notes/addnote`: Add a new note.
- **PUT** `/api/notes/updatenote/:id`: Update an existing note.
- **DELETE** `/api/notes/deletenote/:id`: Delete a note.

## Backend Architecture

The backend is implemented using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, with **MongoDB** as the database. It is designed to provide a secure and efficient API for user authentication and note management.

### Key Backend Components:

1. **Database Connection**:
   - MongoDB is connected using Mongoose.
   - Connection parameters are configured in the `db.js` file.
   - The database URL is set as `mongodb://localhost:27017/mynotebook`.

2. **Authentication**:
   - JWT is used for secure user authentication.
   - Passwords are hashed using `bcryptjs`.
   - Middleware (`fetchuser`) validates JWTs and ensures only authenticated users can access protected routes.

3. **Notes Management**:
   - The `Notes` schema includes fields for the title, description, tag, and user association.
   - CRUD operations are implemented in the `notes.js` route file, with proper error handling and validation.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - All routes include try-catch blocks to handle errors gracefully.
